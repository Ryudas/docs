To set up your environment to develop this theme, clone/fork the repo and run `bundle install`.

To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000/matjek/`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.
