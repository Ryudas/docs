In this tutorial we lead you step-by-step toward setting up the main components
of the Internet-Connected Wheelchair by getting the code, registering on the cloud
platform, running a Python code and running an Arduino code.

# 4 Data Collection with Arduino

In this section we will log short and long press events of a push
button. It highlights that a sensor-based data point can be as simple as a button
event and tell us about how a user make use of it.

## 4.1 Push Button Example

In Atom, copy the folder examples > arduino > push_button_led_log
in your 'wheelchair' folder. Then, open this folder in Arduino IDE.

Looking at the code, we recognise the Arduino-like structure in three blocks:

* Declaration of variables and libraries, available throughout the code.
Note by convention, the constants are in uppercase (variables that will not change
during the programme) while other variables are in lowercase.

```cpp
int BUTTON_PIN = 22; // choose the input pin for the push button
int LED_PIN = 13;    // Choose the output pin for the LED

long LONG_PRESS_TIME = 500; // How long is a 'long press' (minimum, in ms)

long buttonActiveSince = 0; // Since when the button has been pressed (in ms since Arduino started)
boolean longPressActive = false; // Are we currently in a 'long press' event
```

* The setup() method executed once when the Arduino starts;

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(BUTTON_PIN, INPUT);    // declare pushbutton as input
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);      // declare LED as input

  Serial.begin(9600); // setting baud speed for Serial (a baud is a pulse)

}
```

* The Loop() method executed infinitely after the setup method.
**WARNING** -  make sure to replace MY_PROPERTY_ID in this example with the ID of a property you created in Data-Centric Design hub.

```cpp
void loop() {
  // Is button active?
  if (digitalRead(button) == LOW) {
    // if the button was not yet pressed
    if (buttonActiveSince == 0) {
        buttonActiveSince = millis();
    } else if ((millis() - buttonActiveSince > LONG_PRESS_TIME)
                && longPressActive == false) {
          longPressActive = true;
          digitalWrite(led, HIGH);  // turn LED ON
        }
    }

  // Was button active?
  } else {
    // Was Long Press event?
    if (buttonActiveSince > 0) {
      // End Long Press event
      if (longPressActive == true) {
        Serial.println("MY_PROPERTY_ID,2");
        digitalWrite(led, LOW);  // turn LED OFF
        longPressActive = false;

      // End Short Press event
      } else {
        Serial.println("MY_PROPERTY_ID,1");
      }
      buttonActiveSince = 0;
    }
  }

}
```

In this example, we want to detect when a push button is pressed. We will trigger
two type of events when the button is released: 'short' or 'long' press.

The following flow chart illustrates the algorithm of this example code.

![Flowchart Push Button](/docs/assets/res/push_button_flow_chart.png)

In the Arduino IDE, go in the top menu 'Tools > Boards', and  select 'Arduino/Genuino Mega or Mega 2560'

Then press the Verify button (green circle with tick).

## 4.2 Wire Push Button and LED

In this example we need three wires, a resistor, an LED and a push button.

## 4.3 Connect Arduino

Use the USB cable to connect the Arduino to your laptop.

In Arduino IDE, in the top menu Tools > Port select your Arduino

Then press the Flash button to send the code into the Arduino (green circle with right arrow)

In the Arduino IDE, in the top menu 'Tools' open the 'Serial Monitor'.
Look at the input, pressing the push button should turn on the LED and produce a
log in the Serial Monitor.


## 4.4 Update Python Example

The last step is to adapt the Python code on your laptop to read the Serial input
from the Arduino and forward them to the Data-Centric Design Hub.

You can copy the code from examples/serial_example.py in your wheelchair folder.

In this code, we use the environment variable again to provide the thing id and token.

We need an extra environment variable(SERIAL) to specify the serial port. You can find
the port name for it on the Arduino IDE, in the top menu Tools > Ports. For example:

```bash
THING_ID=
THING_TOKEN=
SERIAL=MY_PORT_NAME
```

We are now ready to run the Python code

On Mac

```bash
python3 wheelchair/serial_example.py
```

On Windows

```bash
python wheelchair\serial_example.py
```
